# Music Player App

This project is a simple music player app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates the use of basic string and array methods in JavaScript, as well as the use of CSS for styling and HTML for structuring the web page.

## Files

The project consists of three main files:

1. `script.js`: This is the JavaScript file where all the functionality of the music player is implemented. It includes the logic for playing, pausing, and switching songs, as well as updating the song information display.

2. `html.html`: This is the HTML file that structures the web page. It includes the layout for the music player, including the play/pause button, song information display, and playlist.

3. `styles.css`: This is the CSS file that styles the web page. It includes styles for the music player and playlist, as well as general styles for the page.

## Usage

To use the music player, simply open the `html.html` file in your web browser. You can play and pause songs using the play/pause button, and switch songs using the previous and next buttons. The song information display will update to show the current song's title and artist.

## Customization

You can customize the music player by adding your own songs to the playlist in the `script.js` file. Simply add new song objects to the `songs` array, making sure to include the `title`, `artist`, and `url` properties.

You can also customize the appearance of the music player by modifying the `styles.css` file. For example, you can change the colors, fonts, and layout of the music player and playlist.
